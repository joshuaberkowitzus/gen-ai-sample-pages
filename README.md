# A Simple Resume Webpage & Deepseek.ai Page

This repository hosts two pages on GitHub Pages created with DeepSeek.ai and ChatGPT-01 using the simple prompt:
"Create a simple resume webpage. It should be HTML, CSS, JavaScript and have some interactions and animations."

These pages are meant to compare the ability of DeepSeek and ChatGPT on one shot programming tasks. The homepage and most of this README file were created with ChatGPT.

Both pages are live on GitHub Pages and can be accessed directly from the link below:
